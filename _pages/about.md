Hi and Welcome to my website! 
I am Stefania, a PhD Candidate in Economics at Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies. 

I am interested on the diffusion and effect of new digital technologies at firm level. More specifically, I study the factors behind new technologies' adoption in public and private organizations and how they affect firm performance, mainly in terms of labour productivity. I am also curious about how industrial policies can drive this transformation. 

I employ a variety of microeconometric techniques to study these phenomenons, from more descriptive conditional logit model or spatial survival analysis, to causal inference techniques such as Difference-in-Differences. I work with a droad range of data, spanning from balance sheet firm information from Orbis, to online job postings, earnings call and surveys.  

I have a Master Degree in Economics and Data Analysis (European Master in Official Statistics) with distinctions from the University of Bergamo and a Bachelor degree in Economics and Management from the University of Trento.
