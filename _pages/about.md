Hi! Welcome to my page!
I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa (Italy). 
I am particularly interested in the diffusion and effect of new digital technologies at the firm level. My research interest broadly include: Innovation and Industrial policies, Digital transformation, Innovation diffusion, Labour productivity, Policy evaluation, Industrial dynamics and Evolutionary Economics. 
I use microeconometric techniques, going from panel logit models and survival analysis to causal inference techniques such as Difference-in-Differences. 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
