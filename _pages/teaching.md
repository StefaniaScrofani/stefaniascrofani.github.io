<h3>Working papers</h3>
[1] <b>Technological adoption and Firm Resilience: Understanding the Economic Impact of New Digital Technologies</b> <br>
with Laura Bisio (Istat), Valeria Cirillo (University of Bari), Matteo Lucchese (Istat) and Andrea Mina (Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies) <br>
<i>Abstract</i>: This study investigates the impact of new digital technologies on the resilience of firms to external shocks. Using rare comprehensive data on both the adoption of single and multiple new digital technologies, we employ a Difference-in-Differences methodology with propensity score matching to evaluate how digitalization influenced firms' ability to withstand the COVID-19 crisis. We isolate the effects of adopting 1) a single technology, 2) multiple technologies (the breadth of adoption), and 3) technologies that are complementary to one another. The findings provide novel insights into how firms can shape their investments in new digital technologies to increase the benefits of digitalization, and enhance their ability to navigate future crises. <br>

[2] <b>Innovation Performance Through Collaborations with Public Research Organizations: Conducting and Signaling Mechanisms</b> <br>
with Bastian Krieger (ZEW - Leibniz Centre for European Research; University of Luxembourg) and Linus Strecke (ZEW – Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research) <br>
<i>Abstract</i>: We explore the association between signaling and conducting innovation collaborations with public research organizations and firms' revenues from firm and market novelties. Based on data from the German Community Innovation Survey 2023 and web-based indicators, firms conducting collaboration report higher revenues from market novelties, suggesting their relevance for the performance of more radical innovations. Firms signaling collaboration through website content report higher revenues from firm novelties, suggesting relevance for the performance of more incremental innovations. These findings indicate distinct mechanism in how collaborations with public research organizations relate to innovation performance. <br>

[1] <b>The diffusion of digital services in the Public Administration: patterns and drivers among Italian
Municipalities</b> <br>
with Elena Cefis (University of Bergamo) and Andrea Mina (Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies) <br>
<i>Abstract</i>: This paper examines how various characteristics of top executives influence the decision to digitalize, focusing particularly on the leader's previous career paths, homophily with superiors and tenure. While existing evidence on technology diffusion primarily centers on private organizations, this study takes a novel approach by investigating public institutions, specifically the public administration (PA) of Italian municipalities and their mayors. We employ a fixed effects conditional logit model for panel data, analyzing the adoption of the e-payment service provider (PagoPA) by Italian municipalities from 2012 to 2021. Aligning with existing literature in the strategy domain, we find that mayor's digital skills obtained through previous career paths increases the probability of adoption, while mayor's tenure has an inverse U-shaped relationship with the adoption of new technologies. Furthermore, we observe that homophily with high-ranking supervisors does not increase the propensity for adoption. <br>

[2] <b>Data Driven Innovation. Measuring its Effects on Industries, Firms, and Business Models</b> <br>
with Diletta Abbonato (University of Milano-Bicocca), Gianluca Biggi (Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies), Marco Guerzoni (University of Milano-Bicocca), Arianna Martinelli (Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies) and Federico Tamagni (Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies) <br>
<i>Description</i>: Data-driven innovation is defined by the OECD as the use of data and analytics to improve or foster new products, processes, organisational methods and markets. Using LLMs on earnings call for listed firms and patents for the universe of firms on PatentsView, we identify firms that perform Data-Driven Innovation. The aim of the project is to evaluate how such use of digital technologies for innovation can influence firms' performance. The project is financed by the PRIN project Prot. 2022JHZL37.  <br>
<i>Stage</i>: Analysis in progress <br>
